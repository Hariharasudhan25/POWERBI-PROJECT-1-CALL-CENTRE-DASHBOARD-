CALL CENTER DASHBOARD

PROBLEM STATEMENT :

 KPI REQUIREMENTS ; 

1) TOTAL NO OF CELLS             -- WE NEED TO TRACK AND DISPLAY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CALLS RECEIVED BY OUR CALL CENTER OVER A SPECIFIED PERIOD.

2) TOTAL CALL DURATION IN HOURS  -- IT IS CRUIAL TO UNDERSTAND THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TIME OUR CALL CENTER STAFF SPENDS ON CALLS IN HOURS , WHICH CAN HELP US IN RESOURCES
ALLOCATION AND CAPACITY PLANNING

3) TOTAL CALL DURATION IN MINUTES -- SIMILAR TO THE TOTAL CALL DURATION IN HOURS, THIS KPI ROVIDES THE TOTAL CALL TIME BUT IN MINUTESOFFERING A MORE VIEW OF CALL DURATIONS.

4) AVERAGE CALL DURATION IN MINUTES -- TO ASSESS EFFICEINCY OF OUR AGENTS, WE NEED TO CALCULATE AND DISPLAY THE AVERAGE CALL DURATION IN MINUTES. THIS METRICS CAN HELP 
   IDENTIFY TRENDS IN CALL HANDLING.

5) RESPONSE TIME PERCENTAGE -- RESPONSE TIME IS A CRICIAL FACTOR IN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, THIS KPI SHOULD DISPLAY THE PERCENTAGE OF CALLS ANSWERED WITHIN A PREDEFINED 
   TIME FRAME, HELP US GAUGE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE PROMPT SERVICES.


CHART REQUIREMENTS ;

1)TOTAL CALL BY DAY(COLUMN CHART) - DISPLAY ACOLUMN CHART THAT SHOWS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CALLS ON EACH DAY OVER A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD.

2)TOTAL CALLS BY STATE(FILLED MAP CHART) - CREATE FILLED MAP CHART THAT VISUALIZE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CALLS RECEIVED FROM DIFFERENT STATE OR REGIONS.

3)TOP REASON FOR CALLS(TREE MAP) --IMPLEMENT TREE MAP CHART TO DISPLAY THE TOP REASONS FOR CALLS. EACH BOX IN TREE MAP REPRESENT A CALL REASONS.

4)TOTAL CALLS BY CHANNEL(DONUT CHART)- CREATE DONUT CHART TO SHOWCASE THE DISTRIBUTION OF CALLS BY DIFFERENT COMMUNICATION CHANNELS.

5)TOTAL CALLS BY SENTIMENT(COLUMN CHART)-UTILIZE COLUMN CHART TO ILLUSTRATE DISTRIBUTION OF CALLS BY SENTIMENTS(I.E POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL).

6)TOTAL CALLSS BY CALL CENTRE (BAR CHART)-CREATE A BAR CHART THAT PRESENTS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CALL HANDLED BY EACH CALL CENTRE OR DEPARTMENT.


 GRID;

* CREATE GRID VIEW DASHBOARD DISPLAY TABLE OF ALL CALL DETAILS IN POWERBI , THIS SHOULD ALLOW USER TO EXPORT A GRID OF VARIOUS FILTERS APPLIED.

DAX'S USED TO CREATE NEW TABLE ;

* date table = CALENDAR(MIN('Call Center_Call Center'[Call Timestamp]),MAX('Call Center_Call Center'[Call Timestamp]))

* DAY = FORMAT('date table'[Date],"ddd")

* DAY NO = WEEKDAY('date table'[Date],1) 


DAX'S USED FOR CREATING NEW MEASURES IN CALL CENTRE DATA TABLE ;

* Avg call duration (min) = AVERAGE('Call Center_Call Center'[Call Duration In Minutes])

* ResPonse Time % = CALCULATE([Total calls],'Call Center_Call Center'[Response Time] = "Within SLA" || 'Call Center_Call Center'[Response Time] ="Above SLA") /[Total calls] 

* Total call duration (hrs) = [Total calls duration(min)]/60

* Total calls = count('Call Center_Call Center'[Id])

* Total calls duration(min) = sum('Call Center_Call Center'[Call Duration In Minutes]).
